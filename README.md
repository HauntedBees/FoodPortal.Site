# FoodPortal.Site

## wut
Three websites about food. *Areund the World* is half-blog half-resource as I try to eat food and listen to music from everywhere in the world. *Spiceapedia* is intended to be a single resource for spices and herbs containing information on what to use them with, how to use them, and other useful information. *AltFood Reviews* is a review site for vegan and vegetarian substitutes for non-vegan and non-vegetarian foods.
