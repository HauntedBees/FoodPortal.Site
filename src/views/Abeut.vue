                    as my reference for this, which means I'll be including places that may not officially be considered countries by most of the world, so please don't think
                    I'm making a political statement by including them on here. I probably am, but mostly I just want to try a bunch of food and maybe learn a little bit more
                    about the world. I am not a geopolitical expert and a country's presence or name on this site should not be interpreted as an endorsement of that country's
                    government or an attack on any other country's government. If a place says they're a country named X, I'm gonna quote them on that. If another country says
                    they aren't, that's not my battle. Secondly, I am from California and I speak English. If you are looking for 100% authenticity on regional dishes, you
                    should probably consult a resource from that region, not some dude in California with too much free time and internet access.`,
                    `Some of the dishes hosted here have recipes in the <a href='https://www.hauntedbees.com/databee.html'>DataBee Recipe Format</a>. DataBee is an app also
                    produced by Haunted Bees. DataBee Recipes can be found by clicking on the bee icon next to recipes, and are adapted from the linked recipes technically
                    without permission. I'll worry about the ethics or legality of that once I get a Cease and Desist.`
