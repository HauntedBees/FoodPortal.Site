                    statement by including them on here. I might be, but mostly I just want to try a bunch of food and maybe learn a little bit more about the world.
                    I am not a geopolitical expert and a country's presence or name on this site should not be interpreted as an endorsement of that country's government or an
                    attack on any other country's government. If a place says they're a country with a certain name, I'm gonna quote them on that. If another place says they aren't,

                    should probably consult a resource from that region, not some dude in California with too much free time and internet access. If you see a factual issue with any
                    content on this site (i.e. inaccurate information about a country, a recipe is really inauthentic), I apologise; please let me know so I can correct these issues.
                    Alternatively, if you are more knowledgeable about a given country's cuisine or music than I am (you are) and have a recommendation or suggestion, even for a country
                    I haven't covered yet, I'd love to hear from you, too! I try to avoid mentioning current events in country descriptions, but when I do they may become outdated -
                    if that happens, let me know! I will regularly try to update those when appropriate, and I will try to ensure that all external links are still valid. If
                    you find a dead link to a recipe or song, let me know so I can replace it with an archived version or a different link.`,

                    produced by Haunted Bees. DataBee Recipes can be found by clicking on the bee icon next to recipes, and are adapted from the linked recipes technically
                    without permission. I'll worry about the ethics or legality of that once I get a Cease and Desist.`,
